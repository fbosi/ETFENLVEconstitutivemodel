This folder contains the material parameters for both the models, in order to be read by the MATLAB file.

- CTE.csv contains the polynomial coefficients for the thermal strains determination;

- D11_Opt_1e5MPa.csv, D22_Opt_1e5MPa.csv, D66_Opt_1e5MPa.csv are the relaxation times and correspondant 
  Prony series terms of the compliances in direction MD, TD and ID, respectively;

- ISO.csv is the same as the point above, but for the isotropic model;

- EA11_1e5MPa.csv, EA22_1e5MPa.csv, EA66_1e5MPa.csv are the activation energies determined for the master curves
  in direction MD, TD and ID, respectively;

- EAISO.csv is the same as the point above but for the isotropicmaster curve;

- 240304_EyringISO2.csv is the activation Volume for the isotropic model.
