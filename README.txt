This repository contains:
- a MATLAB file: "etfeNLveModel.m" which can simulate the behavior of ETFE:
  the output of the simulation can be the strain or the stress;
- the folder "rawData", which contains some experimental data read by the MATLAB file;
- the folder "materialVariables", which contains the material parameters, read by the MATLAB file;
- the folder "UMAT", which contains the subroutine to be used in ABAQUS and 
  the list of material parameters associated.
